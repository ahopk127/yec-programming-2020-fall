# YEC Programming Competition 2020 Fall â€“ Team Rocket's Submission

This repository contains Team Rocket's solution for the York Engineering Competition (YEC) Programming Competition held in Fall 2020. The project focuses on Conway's Game of Life with additional variations and rules implemented as part of the competition's unique requirements.

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. The competition tasked participants with simulating the game while introducing custom variations and extra rules to enhance the complexity and realism of the simulation. This repository showcases our team's solution to the challenge, demonstrating our problem-solving skills, creativity, and proficiency in Python.

## Features

- **Standard Conway's Game of Life Simulation**: Implements the classic rules governing cell birth, survival, and death.
- **Custom Variations**: Introduced new mechanics and rules specific to the competition's requirements, adding layers of complexity to the simulation.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Designed with efficient algorithms to handle large grids and rapid iterations.

## Getting Started

To run the program, execute the `specimen_f.py` script:

```bash
python specimen_f.py
```

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following components: 

`data/` - Contains datasets used by the program. 

`specimen_f.py` - Main executable script containing the simulation logic.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
